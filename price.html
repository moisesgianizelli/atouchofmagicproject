    <h3>Classes</h3>
    <p>To help budding bakers that can’t wait for in person classes, I have made an Online Kids Baking Camp, which gives immediate access to 5 x 1 hour baking classes so that kids can take the classes at home, with a little assistance from a parent if needed.
    The beauty of the precorded sessions is that they can watch them in any order, pause if needed, watch them over and over again on whatever day they choose.
    Let them take over the kitchen, learn a life skill, treat the whole family & have fun while doing so! </p>
    
    <h3>Cakes</h3>
    <p>Bespoke wedding cakes specializing in chocolate, cocoa butter painting and edible works of art, my love now extends to teaching kids and adults alike.</p>

    <h3>Book</h3>
    <p>this book is dedicated to all those who whisked, cracked, walloped and smashed their way through all my recipes during lockdown and kept smiling. Had it not been for your continuous support, I would never have written this book.</p>
